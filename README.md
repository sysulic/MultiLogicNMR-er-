# MultiLogicNMRer
This is the official repository for the paper "MultiLogicNMR(er): A Benchmark and Neural-Symbolic Framework for Non-monotonic Reasoning with Multiple Extensions" publish by EMNLP 2025.

This repository contains the implementation of the MultiLogicNMRer framework and the three related datasets introduced in the paper. Non-monotonic reasoning (NMR) refers to the fact that conclusions may be invalidated by new information, a key aspect of human reasoning. An NMR task often results in multiple plausible sets of conclusions, known as "extensions". This project provides tools to evaluate and enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle such complex reasoning scenarios.

(Note: This figure provides an intuitive example of how a diagnosis for a patient with chest pain changes from "acid reflux" to potentially "acid reflux" or a "heart attack" after learning about "shortness of breath".)


# Datasets
The Datasets directory contains three benchmark datasets (MultiLogicNMR, MultiLogicNMR_OOD, MultiLoigcNMR_NL) designed to evaluate Non-monotonic Reasoning. Each dataset includes both skeptical and credulous reasoning modes. Every sample contains a context with facts and default rules, along with three questions. The datasets are generated via a comprehensive pipeline that includes: 1) generating formal default theories, 2) solving them with an ASP (Answer Set Programming) solver to find all extensions, 3) translating the formal logic into natural language templates, and 4) rewriting the templated text with an LLM to increase linguistic diversity.

(Note: This figure illustrates the four-stage dataset generation process.)


**MultiLogicNMR** This is the core multi-extension NMR dataset.

1. Purpose: To evaluate multi-extension NMR capabilities of LLMs.

2. Number of Extensions: Each sample has a number of extensions belonging to the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.


**MultiLogicNMR_OOD** This dataset was created to assess the generalization ability of models to a larger number of extensions.

1. Purpose: To evaluate out-of-distribution generalization based on the number of extensions.

2. Number of Extensions: Each sample has a number of extensions belonging to the set {6, 8, 10, 12, 16}.

**MultiLogicNMR_NL** This dataset was constructed by rewriting samples from MultiLogicNMR with an LLM (GPT-4o-mini) to increase linguistic variety. To ensure logical correctness, the rewriting process was validated using semantic equivalence and predicate alignment checks.

1. Purpose: To evaluate the robustness of models against diverse natural language expressions.


2. Number of Extensions: Same as MultiLogicNMR, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

# Code

The Code directory contains the implementation of the MultiLogicNMRer neural-symbolic framework. This framework is based on the bound-based algorithm for ASP solving and uses LLMs to perform single-step reasoning operations.

 ![Figure 1: An example of multi-extension NMR](https://github.com/sysulic/MultiLogicNMRer/blob/main/Framework.png)
 
 (Note: This figure shows the six modules of the MultiLogicNMRer framework: Grounding, Bound Initialization, Reduction, Reasoning, Selection, and Label Generation.)


**Models_on_MultiLogicNMR**ï¼šContains the code for running MultiLogicNMRer with different LLMs on the MultiLogicNMR dataset.

For example, the MultiLogicNMR_Solver_on_credulous_by_DeepSeek.py file in the Models_on_MultiLogicNMR refers to the code of MultiLogicNMRer based on DeepSeek on the MultiLogicNMR dataset in credulous reasoning.

**Models_on_MultiLogicNMR_OOD**: Contains the code for running MultiLogicNMRer with different LLMs on the MultiLogicNMR_OOD dataset.

**Models_on_MultiLogicNMR_NL**: Contains the code for running MultiLogicNMRer with different LLMs on the MultiLogicNMR_NL dataset.

**Models_on_LogicNMR**: Contains the code for running MultiLogicNMRer with GPT-4o-mini on the LogicNMR dataset, as described in the experiments.

For example, the file MultiLogicNMR_Solver_on_credulous_by_DeepSeek.py in the Models_on_MultiLogicNMR directory refers to the code for the MultiLogicNMRer framework using the DeepSeek model on the MultiLogicNMR dataset in credulous reasoning mode.
